		\section*{Introduction}
		\vskip 1cm
		This document is a report for the individual project ``Simulation of various CPU scheduling algorithms and analysing the behaviour of each scheduler". CPU scheduling is a process which allows one process to use the CPU while the execution of another process is on hold(in waiting state) due to unavailability of any resource like I/O etc, thereby making full use of CPU. The aim of CPU scheduling is to make the system efficient, fast and fair.\\

		\end{figure}
		\vskip 1cm

		The project is an attempt to differentiate the behaviour of each scheduler with the statistical approach. In this project we performed each CPU scheduling and compared them on the basis of their completion time,throughput,average job elapsed time and average job waiting time during the process. It also discusses the complexity of the written code as instructed.

		\section*{Conclusion}
		\vskip 1cm
		\large{{From the given project work we have concluded that the difference between the turn around time,average waiting time,average elapsed time and completion time for same input of different cpu scheduling is as follows:-}

		\begin{figure}[H]
		    \centering
		    \includegraphics[scale=0.9]{compare.png}
		    \caption{comparison between CPU scheduling.}
		\end{figure}
		\vskip 1cm
		\large{from the above graph we came to know that every algorithm works better on the significant problem as the fcfs is better for a small burst time.The sjf is better if the process comes to processor simultaneously and round robin, is better to adjust the average waiting time desired and the priorty works better  where the relative important of each process may be precisely defined.}
