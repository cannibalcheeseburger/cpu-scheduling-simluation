## TITLE

Simulate various CPU scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF-peemptive & nonpeemptive, Priority Scheduling-peemptive & nonpeemptive and Round Robin). Run your simulator for each scheduling policy, with a variety of quantum values. For each version of the simulator, for each input data file, for each quantum value, plot the completion time, throughput, average job elapsed time and average job waiting time. Analyze the behavior of your scheduler.
